    ## Instructions
    
    You are asked to perform a focused examination of the knee joint on a 28-year-old patient 
    who presents with right knee pain following a football match 2 weeks ago. The patient reports 
    feeling a "pop" and experiencing immediate swelling.
    
    **Time allowed:** 8 minutes
    
    **Tasks:**
    1. Take a focused history
    2. Perform a systematic knee examination
    3. Explain your findings and differential diagnosis to the examiner
